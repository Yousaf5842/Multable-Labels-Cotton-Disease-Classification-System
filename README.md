Multi-Label Cotton Diseases Classification Using MobileNetV2
Proud to share my latest computer vision project for cotton crop disease detection! 🌾 Using deep learning and real-world field data, this model accurately classifies four key disease classes:

✔️ Whitefly
✔️ Potassium Deficiency
✔️ Sooty Mold
✔️ Healthy
✔️ Mealy Bug
✔️ Jassis
 predicting multiple aspects of a crop image:

✔️ Disease Type (Whitefly, Potassium Deficiency, Sooty Mold, Healthy)
✔️ Cotton Type
✔️ Crop Age
✔️ Growth Stage
✔️ Disease Severity
✔️ Disease Probability
Summary
This project was developed as part of my work in the company. Several CNN architectures were tested, but MobileNetV2 achieved the best results in terms of accuracy and classification performance.
