Multi-Label Cotton Diseases Classification Using MobileNetV2
Proud to share my latest computer vision project for cotton crop disease detection! 🌾 Using deep learning and real-world field data, this model accurately classifies four key disease classes:

✔️ Whitefly
✔️ Potassium Deficiency
✔️ Sooty Mold
✔️ Healthy

Crop Type
Crop Disease
Crop Severity
Crop Age
Crop Stage
Disease Classes
The dataset includes six classes:

Potassium Deficiency
Mealy Bug
Whitefly
Sooty Mold
Jassid
Healthy Images
Summary
This project was developed as part of my work in the company. Several CNN architectures were tested, but MobileNetV2 achieved the best results in terms of accuracy and classification performance.
