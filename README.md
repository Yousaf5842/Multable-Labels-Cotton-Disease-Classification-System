# Multable-Labels-Cotton-Disease-Classification-System
Multi-Label Cotton Diseases Classification Using MobileNetV2
This project focuses on multi-label classification of cotton crop diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the MobileNetV2 architecture. The model predicts five key attributes:

Crop Type
Crop Disease
Crop Severity
Crop Age
Crop Stage
Disease Classes
The dataset includes six classes:

Potassium Deficiency
Mealy Bug
Whitefly
Sooty Mold
Jassid
Healthy Images
Summary
This project was developed as part of my work in the company. Several CNN architectures were tested, but MobileNetV2 achieved the best results in terms of accuracy and classification performance.
